            <h1>Perl 6 Community Servers</h1>
            <p>The servers under the p6c.org domain are dedicated to
            <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> development by providing
            shell accounts, hosting websites and other services (such as smoke
            testing and IRC bots)</p>

            <p>The hardware was funded by donations from the Perl 6 community, and
            housing and network is generously provided by <a href="http://noris.net">noris
            network.</a></p>

        <section id="servers">
            <h2>Servers</h2>
            <p>The server with the most resources is <code>hack.p6c.org</code>, which offers shell
            accounts for Perl 6 compiler, module and application development, as well as IRC
            sessions.</p>
            <p><code>www.p6c.org</code> hosts many Perl 6-related websites, including <a
            href="http://perl6.org/">the perl6.org main site</a>, <a
            href="http://doc.perl6.org/">doc.perl6.org</a>, <a
            href="http://modules.perl6.org/">modules.perl6.org</a> and <a
            href="http://design.perl6.org/">the Perl 6 design documents</a>.</p>
            <p>A third virtual machine is planned for high-risk applications (such as websites that
            evaluate Perl 6 code) is planned, and will be deployed on demand.</p>
            <p><a href="https://github.com/perl6/infrastructure-doc/tree/master/hosts">technical
            documentation</a> is available.</p>

        <section id="access">
            <h2>How to get Access</h2>
            <p>If you have a Perl 6 related use case for a shell account, please send an email to
            moritz@faui2k3.org, stating your cause and desired username. If you want to host public
            websites, and thus need access to the www server as well, please say so to. Also include
            any non-standard software (Debian packages) that you need.</p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct and Disclaimer</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Be reasonable in your resource usage.</li>
                <li>Use technical means to limit your resource usage so that it doesn't accidentally explode (<a href="http://www.linuxhowtos.org/Tips%20and%20Tricks/ulimit.htm">ulimit</a> comes to mind).</li>
                <li>Limit yourself to legal and Perl 6-related use cases (no warez).</li>
                <li>Help your fellow hackers.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>The standard disclaimer applies:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Expect no privacy. There will potentially be many <code>root</code> users, who could all read your files and memory.</li>
                <li>There are no promises of continued service or even support. Your account can be terminated without notice.</li>
                <li>Place of jurisdiction in Nürnberg, Germany. You have to comply with German law while using the server. (Note that this puts pretty high standards on privacy for any user data you collect, including from web applications). It's your duty to inform yourself about the applicable laws. Illegal activities will be reported to the authorities.</li>
