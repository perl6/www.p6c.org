                <h1>Perl 6 Community Servers</h1>
                <p>The servers under the p6c.org domain are dedicated to
                <a href="http://perl6.org/">Perl 6</a> development by providing
                shell accounts, hosting websites and other services (such as smoke
                testing and IRC bots)</p>

                <p>The hardware was funded by donations from the Perl 6 community, and
                housing and network is generously provided by <a href="http://noris.net">noris
                network.</a></p>

                    <h2>Servers</h2>
                    <p>The server with the most resources is <code>hack.p6c.org</code>, which offers shell
                    accounts for Perl 6 compiler, module and application development, as well as IRC
                    sessions.</p>
                    <p><code>www.p6c.org</code> hosts many Perl 6-related websites, including <a
                    href="http://perl6.org/">the perl6.org main site</a>, <a
                    href="http://doc.perl6.org/">doc.perl6.org</a>, <a
                    href="http://modules.perl6.org/">modules.perl6.org</a> and <a
                        href="http://design.perl6.org/">the Perl 6 design documents</a>.</p>
                    <p>A third virtual machine is planned for high-risk applications (such as websites that
                    evaluate Perl 6 code) is planned, and will be deployed on demand.</p>

                    <p>If you have a Perl 6 related use case for a shell account, please send an email to
                    <b>moritz.lenz@gmail.com</b>, stating your cause and desired username. If you want to host public
                    websites, and thus need access to the www server as well, please say so. Also include
                    any non-standard software (Debian packages) that you need.</p>
